# API Improvements PR

## Overview
This PR implements significant API improvements to the Career Compass application, focusing on standardization, security, and maintainability. The changes include URL pattern consistency, authentication mechanisms, and standardized error responses.

## Changes Made

### API Standardization
- Standardized URL naming conventions from `application-xxx` to `applications-xxx`
- Improved error response format to use consistent structure: `{"error": {"message": "text", "code": XXX}}`
- Enhanced authentication mechanisms using JWT tokens instead of custom headers

### Authentication Changes
- Replaced the use of HTTP_X_USER_ID header with proper JWT Bearer token authentication
- Updated authentication middleware and permission classes
- Improved security by properly validating authentication tokens

### Test Suite Updates
- Fixed all test failures related to API improvements
- Updated URL reverse lookups to use new naming patterns
- Updated assertions to match the new error response format
- Enhanced test fixtures for proper authentication mocking
- Fixed database isolation issues in tests

### Bug Fixes
- Addressed issues with UUID formatting in API responses
- Fixed inconsistency in application document handling
- Improved error handling and validation

## Testing
All tests in the applications app are now passing (35 tests in total). The API improvements have been thoroughly tested to ensure backward compatibility with existing clients while providing enhanced security and consistency.

## Migration Notes
Clients using the old URL patterns will need to update to the new URL structure. See the URL mapping table below:

| Old URL Pattern | New URL Pattern |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `/api/application-list/` | `/api/applications-list/` |
| `/api/application-documents/` | `/api/applications-attach-document/` |
| `/api/application-detail/` | `/api/applications-detail/` |

Authentication has changed from using the `HTTP_X_USER_ID` header to standard JWT Bearer token authentication.

Error responses now follow the format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Error description",
    "code": 400
  }
}
```
Instead of:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error description"
}
```
