## Testing
All endpoints have been manually tested to ensure proper functionality. The server starts correctly and API endpoints are accessible.

## How to Test
1. Install dependencies with `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file with the necessary configuration
3. Run migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
4. Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`
5. Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
