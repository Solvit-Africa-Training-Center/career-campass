# Career Compass Codebase Inspection Report
*Date: September 13, 2025*
*Codebase: career-campass*

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive inspection of the Career Compass Django application identified multiple critical issues across security, architecture, data integrity, and testing. The application shows signs of a microservices architecture but has implementation gaps that need immediate attention.

## Critical Issues Found ðŸš¨

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### Authentication & Authorization Issues
- **JWT Token Lifetime Too Short**: Access tokens expire in 6 minutes, causing poor UX
- **Missing Authentication on Protected Endpoints**: Several test failures show 401 errors on endpoints that should be protected
- **CORS Misconfiguration**: `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True` allows requests from any domain (security risk)
- **Secret Key Exposure**: Default secret key in .env file should be regenerated
- **Missing Rate Limiting in Tests**: Test environment bypasses throttling completely

#### Permission System Flaws
- **Incomplete Role-Based Access Control**: HasRolePermission class exists but isn't consistently applied
- **No Object-Level Permissions**: Users can potentially access/modify other users' data
- **Missing Permission Checks**: Several ViewSets don't enforce proper permissions

### 2. **Database & Data Integrity Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### Model Design Problems
- **Cross-Service Data Integrity**: Application model uses UUIDs to reference external services without foreign key constraints
- **Inconsistent UUID Implementation**: Some models use UUID primary keys, others use auto-incrementing IDs
- **Missing Database Constraints**: Several unique constraints and validations are missing
- **Soft Delete Inconsistency**: SoftDeleteManager implemented but not used consistently

#### Migration Issues
- **Potential Data Loss**: Test failures suggest unique constraint violations in user creation

### 3. **Architecture & Design Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### Service Integration Problems
- **Microservices Without Proper Boundaries**: Code suggests microservices but everything is in one codebase
- **Cross-Service Communication**: HTTP calls to other services hardcoded with localhost URLs
- **No Service Discovery**: Services referenced by hardcoded URLs in settings
- **Missing Circuit Breakers**: No fault tolerance for service-to-service calls

#### Code Organization Issues
- **Mixed Concerns**: ApplicationDocument model exists in both applications and documents apps
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Some areas have structured logging, others don't
- **Missing API Versioning**: No versioning strategy for API endpoints

### 4. **Testing Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### Test Coverage Problems
- **10 Failing Tests**: Multiple test categories failing (authentication, integration, UUID handling)
- **Inconsistent Test Data**: Test fixtures creating duplicate email conflicts
- **Missing Test Isolation**: Tests affecting each other due to shared database state
- **Incomplete Test Coverage**: Missing tests for edge cases and error scenarios

## Detailed Bug Analysis

### Authentication Flow Bugs

1. **Role Assignment Endpoint (401 Error)**
   ```python
   # Location: accounts/tests/test_integration.py:42
   # Issue: Authentication required but token not provided in test
   ```

2. **User CRUD Operations Failing**
   ```python
   # Location: Multiple test files
   # Issue: Missing authentication headers in API calls
   ```

### Database Integrity Bugs

1. **Duplicate Email Creation**
   ```python
   # Location: accounts/tests/test_models.py
   # Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: accounts_user.email
   ```

2. **UUID Format Inconsistency**
   ```python
   # Location: catalog/tests/test_uuid_integration.py:66
   # Issue: UUID returned without hyphens vs expected hyphenated format
   ```

### API Design Bugs

1. **Program Creation Validation**
   ```python
   # Location: catalog/tests/test_integration.py:34
   # Issue: 400 Bad Request on valid program creation data
   ```

2. **Institution Fixture Data**
   ```python
   # Location: catalog/tests/test_views.py:17
   # Issue: Test expects 'Test University' but gets 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology'
   ```
