# Test Fixes Summary

## Categories of Test Fixes

### 1. URL Pattern Changes
We updated URL names throughout the test files to match the new API URL structure:
- Changed `application-list` to `applications-list`
- Changed `application-documents` to `applications-attach-document`
- Changed `application-detail` to `applications-detail`

This required fixes in `reverse()` calls and URL patterns used in tests.

### 2. Authentication Changes
We updated authentication mechanisms in tests:
- Enhanced the `authenticated_api_client` fixture to properly mock JWT authentication
- Added appropriate student UUID mocking
- Fixed authentication in integration tests by providing proper JWT tokens
- Updated view mocks to handle the new authentication flow

### 3. Error Response Format Changes
We updated assertions to match the new error response format:
- Changed from checking `response.data['detail']` to `response.data['error']['message']`
- Updated tests to match the new standardized error response structure
- Adjusted expected error formats in all test assertions

### 4. Database Isolation Fixes
We improved database isolation in tests:
- Changed assertions from checking global counts (`Application.objects.count()`) to filtering by specific criteria (`Application.objects.filter(program_id=program_id).exists()`)
- Added specific filtering in queries to avoid test interference
- Fixed test ordering and dependencies to ensure consistent database state

### 5. Test Fixture Improvements
We enhanced fixtures for more reliable tests:
- Improved the `authenticated_api_client` fixture
- Added better mocking for UUIDs and IDs
- Fixed fixture dependencies and initialization
- Added proper cleanup to prevent test interference
